Randome Joke API is a RESTful web service created using the Spring Boot framework. This API provides random jokes via HTTP endpoints and can be easily integrated into other applications or used as a fun standalone service.

## Features

- Returns random jokes via a simple API endpoint
- Built with Java and Spring Boot
- Uses in-memory H2 database for development
- Includes development tools and testing support

## Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Java 21+**
- **Spring Boot**
  - spring-boot-starter-web (for REST API)
  - spring-boot-starter-data-jpa (for data persistence)
  - spring-boot-devtools (for hot reload during development)
  - spring-boot-starter-test (for testing)
- **H2 Database** (in-memory database for development)
- **Lombok** (to reduce boilerplate code)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or newer

}
```

### Testing
